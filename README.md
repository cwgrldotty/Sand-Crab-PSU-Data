Abstract	Microplastics are increasingly recognized as widespread in marine systems, however, the effects of these particles on marine fauna are not well known. Ocean-borne plastic debris accumulates in littoral ecosystems around the world, and invertebrate infauna inhabiting these systems can ingest small plastic particles, mistaking them for food items. We examined the effect of microplastics on physiological and reproductive outcomes in a nearshore organism by exposing Pacific mole crabs (Emerita analoga), collected from Newport, Oregon, to environmentally relevant concentrations of micro-sized fibers of polypropylene rope. We compared adult gravid female crab mortality, reproductive success , and egg developmental rates between microfiber-exposed and control crabs. Pacific mole crabs exposed to polypropylene rope had increased adult crab mortality, and decreased reproductive performance and egg development rates.  These effects of microplastic ingestion on a nearshore prey item have implications for near shore predators such as surf perf and shore birds, as plastic use, and resultant microplastic presence in nearshore environments increases.

Time frame - Begin date	August 4, 2017

General study design	Laboratory experiment – separate mesocosms for 64 individuals( Emerita analoga), half control, half treatment – exposure to polypropylene microfibers. Measured continuation of gravid adult females carrying viable eggs, development stage of clutch of eggs and adult mortality over a 71 day period.
Methods description	In the laboratory, each crab carapace length was measured in mm and recorded then placed into a 1L Mason jar with four centimeters of sand collected from Newport, OR.  Artificial sea water (Instant Ocean) filled the rest of the jar and a lid with an aerator was placed on top. Jars were numbered to identify organisms and placed in a salt water bath maintained at 11C (Figure 1).  Daily, 300mL of water was removed from each jar and replaced with fresh artificial sea water (Instant Ocean) and food. Food (ATLMSPD4 Marine Snow Plankton Diet) (conc. 5ml per Liter of salt water) was mixed in with fresh Instant Ocean salt water; nitrates and pH were monitored daily to maintain a controlled environment for the 64 crabs. Crabs were divided into two groups, control (N=32) and treatment (N=32).  In each treatment jar, three 1mm pieces of bright yellow polypropylene rope were added to the water every four days over a 71-day period, or until female crab mortality occurred. The microplastic exposure concentration was based on tested seawater collected in Newport, OR when crabs were collected. Since the lowest microplastic density in seawater was three microplastic fibers/L, this concentration was applied to the experiment to maintain environmental relevance.  Every fourth day, four to ten live eggs were retrieved from each crab and frozen for subsequent analysis of larval development stage. At the end of the experiment, remaining live crabs were frozen whole in individual containers and saved for digestion. 
Laboratory, field, or other analytical methods	Sand collection - Surface sand samples (less than 5cm depth) were collected at 19 beaches along the Oregon coast to identify whether sand crabs inhabiting these sediments are exposed to microplastics (fibers and particles) coastwide.  Samples were brought to the Applied Coastal Ecology (ACE) Lab at Portland State University (PSU) and a density separation technique (Thompson et al., 2004, Horn et al. 2019) was used to separate fibers and particles from sand samples.  Samples were analyzed using a 10X Leica dissecting microscope with Leica camera connected to a computer running Leica Application Suite X Imaging Software and fibers and particles were visually identified by color and shape.
Water Collection - At South Beach in Newport, Oregon, three, 1L water samples were collected in the swash zone where the crabs were collected. The water was transported to the laboratory at PSU and filtered thru a 47mm glass fiber filter (Whatman 1820-047 Glass Microfiber Binder Free Filter, 1.6 Micron, 4.3 s/100mL Flow Rate, Grade GF/A, 47mm Diameter) using a vacuum system. The filter was examined under the dissecting scope to determine the number of microplastics per volume of water.
Field collection of Emerita analoga - In the summer of 2017, 64 sand crabs were collected from South Beach, Newport, OR using a shovel and bucket. Crabs were selected if eggs were visually identified on the exterior of the crab. Selected gravid (egg-bearing) crabs were placed into a bucket with sand and seawater and transported live to the ACE Lab at PSU. 
Laboratory Experiment - In the laboratory, each crab carapace length was measured in mm and recorded then placed into a 1L Mason jar with four centimeters of sand collected from Newport, OR.  Artificial sea water (Instant Ocean) filled the rest of the jar and a lid with an aerator was placed on top. Jars were numbered to identify organisms and placed in a salt water bath maintained at 11C (Figure 1).  Daily, 300mL of water was removed from each jar and replaced with fresh artificial sea water (Instant Ocean) and food. Food (ATLMSPD4 Marine Snow Plankton Diet) (conc. 5ml per Liter of salt water) was mixed in with fresh Instant Ocean salt water; nitrates and pH were monitored daily to maintain a controlled environment for the 64 crabs. Crabs were divided into two groups, control (N=32) and treatment (N=32).  In each treatment jar, three 1mm pieces of bright yellow polypropylene rope were added to the water every four days over a 71-day period, or until female crab mortality occurred. The microplastic exposure concentration was based on tested seawater collected in Newport, OR when crabs were collected. Since the lowest microplastic density in seawater was three microplastic fibers/L, this concentration was applied to the experiment to maintain environmental relevance.  Every fourth day, four to ten live eggs were retrieved from each crab and frozen for subsequent analysis of larval development stage. At the end of the experiment, remaining live crabs were frozen whole in individual containers and saved for digestion. 
Larval Stage Identification - Four to ten eggs were collected from gravid females every fourth day to assess developmental stage (1-10) and photographed using a 10X Leica dissecting microscope connected via a Leica camera to a computer running Leica Application Suite X Imaging Software (Table 1).  Larval crab development stage (1-10) was determined according to the methods of Boolootian et al. 1959.
Crab Digestion - Each frozen adult crab was transferred to a clean glass petri dish, thawed, and carapace length and width were measured using a digital caliper (Neiko 01407A Electronic Digital Caliper). Each crab was then digested in a 10% KOH solution for 24 hours at 40C. (Rochman et al. 2016, Baechler et al. In Press, this issue). The solution was filtered through a 63μm steel mesh, then the residue was transferred into a glass petri dish and examined under a 10X Leica dissecting microscope to determine whether the yellow polypropylene fibers had been ingested. 
Quality Control - To minimize contamination, 100% cotton clothing was worn during field collection and lab work and new nitrile gloves were worn for each sample. Each piece of glassware was rinsed three times with deionized water and covered before use.  
Data Analysis - All data analysis was conducted using RStudio (Version 1.0.153).  To assess the effect of microplastic exposure on adult crab mortality, a chi-squared test was performed on the number of days each crab survived during the experiment.  To examine the effect of microplastics on the number of days each adult crab held viable/live eggs in her clutch, we used a chi-squared test. To conduct a deeper analysis of the data, we used  R (Version 1.0.153) and lme4 (Bates, Maechler & Bolker, 2012) to perform a linear mixed effects model of the relationship between exposure to microplastic fibers and adult mortality and to test for effects of exposure to microplastic fibers on egg development. Using this model we are able to deal with non-normally distributed data that involves fixed ecological effects as well as random effects that are replicated over time.

Fixed effects, which will have systematic and predictable influences on the data (Winter 2013),  included the number of yellow microplastic fibers internalized by each adult crab, adult sand crab size, whether the sand crab went through a molt during the experiment, the number of parasites in the adult sand crab gut, and the starting stage of the eggs each sand crab was carrying. Interdependence of fixed effects are further discussed in the results. Random effects, that tend to have unpredictable influences on data (Winter 2013), were intercepts for control and treatment, as well as by-control and by-treatment random slopes for the effects of microplastic fibers. By adding the random effects in the model we were able to resolve the non-independence by categorizing developmental stages (i.e., if eggs started at stage 2, 4, 8 etc).  Visual inspection of residual plots did not reveal any obvious deviations from homoscedasticity or normality.  To show significance level for each fixed effect, we created full models that included all fixed effects, and removed a factor creating a reduced model to compare it.  The concept is to use the Likelihood Ratio Test to compare the likelihood of the two models to each other (Winter 2013).  This allows us to see if each fixed effects was significant within the model. Then using a Likelihood Ratio Test between the full and reduced models to obtain a Chi-squared value, the associated degrees of freedom, and the p-value we could determine which factor, or fixed effect was significant.
